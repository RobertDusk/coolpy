## Text manipulation

- [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) - Rich is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.The Rich API makes it easy to add color and style to terminal output. Rich can also render pretty tables, progress bars, markdown, syntax highlighted source code, tracebacks, and more â€” out of the box.

## CLI
- [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click/) - Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command Line Interface Creation Kit". It's highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box. It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement an intended CLI API.

- [simple-term-menu](https://github.com/IngoMeyer441/simple-term-menu) - simple-term-menu creates simple menus for interactive command line programs. It can be used to offer a choice of different options to the user. Menu entries can be selected with the arrow, j/k, or emacs (C-n/C-p) keys. The module uses the terminfo database to detect terminal features automatically and disables styles that are not available. Currently, Linux and macOS are supported.
